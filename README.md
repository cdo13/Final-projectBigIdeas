# Abstract

### This is an assessment of the best neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh area using our own metric to evaluate the conclusion. We are focused on the neighborhood that will provide the highest amount of recreational service to the community. We used three different  datasets provided by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. We focused on the datasets allocated to Playgrounds, Swimming Pools, and Courts in the neighborhood. With the provided data, we calculated the neighborhoods with the most playgrounds, the most courts, and the most pools with an acceptable type of the body of water available in that neighborhood.
